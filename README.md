# MangManager
A lightweight World of Warcraft addon manager.

Usage:
edit config.ini

first line is the path to your wow addon folder.
second line is "retail" or "classic" depending on what version u want addons for

then each line after that put in the name of the addon you want as it appears on curseforge.com then run the program and it will automatically download the latest version of each addon.

Right now i only tested this with linux, to be used for when I play the game through wine, but if you use like cygwin or whatever it probably will compile just fine there.
